# Multidimensional_Scaling

Mulidimensional scaling (MDS) is a visual representation of distances or dissimilarities between sets of objects. “Objects” can be colors, faces, map coordinates, political persuasion, or any kind of real or conceptual stimuli (Kruskal and Wish, 1978). Its main goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by finding a set of points that will relatively reflect the configuration of our original high-dimensional set. This reduction usually leads to a two-dimensional set, so that we can get a 2D spatial representation of the “objects”.

To implement the MDS model, 11  clothing retail stores accessible in the U.S. have been selected: Forever 21, Zara, H&M, Ross, Marshall’s, T.J. Maxx, Macy’s, JC Penny, GUESS, Old Navy, and Levis. Then, an opinion of the similarities amongst the stores is defined in a scale from 0-10, 0 indicating the very least similarity and 10, the highest similarity between stores. The overall subjective opinion is found on the table below.
